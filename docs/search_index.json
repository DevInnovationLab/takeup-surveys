It is a work in progress meant to keep all the partners in the loop of how analysis is advancing. The numbers shown in this document will change as we collect more data and address issues identified in the field. The DIL team is double-coding the analysis numbers, and we have not yet validated the estimates in this document. "],["annecdotes-from-the-field-incomplete.html", "2 Annecdotes from the field (Incomplete)", " 2 Annecdotes from the field (Incomplete) In some villages where most of the taps were water collection points, the field team classified all taps as ILC. We are still confirming whether these are correct classifications or not. In Uganda, the field teams only received the second batch of colorimeters at the very end on data collection. This will reduce our power for colorimeter take-up estimates. We observed that in Malawi, it is rare for households to collect water with a jerrican. They typically use a bucket, which means the chlorine evaporates faster and there is more risk of recontamination. To do: check water storage in the household In some villages, the promoters filled the dispenser after they saw the FOs inspecting it Three villages in Uganda were replaced after the field team realized that the chairperson and the promoter were expecting the data collection. In one village in Uganda, the promoter distributed water to be tested if asked by IPA. Two villages in Uganda was replaced because no dispensers were found. In one of these cases, the dispenser was located in a neighboring village, that was used as replacement In Malawi, the coordinates received from Evidence Action are less accurate than those from Uganda. It seems like some of the dispensers have been moved, a few are in water sources that are no longer functional, and new dispensers have been installed that are not in the database. It is also harder to see dispenser IDs in the slabs.
