\section{Survey design}

\subsection{Sampling strategy}

The main objective of this survey was to identify households whose primary source of drinking water had a DSW dispenser or was connected to ILC, and estimate what share of these households used chlorine to treat their drinking water. 

We chose to ask households about their primary source of drinking water to identify those using water points with DSW. In their Adoption Monitoring, Evidence Action identifies these households by asking a single knowledgeable person in the village (most commonly the promoter) which households are those. However, third-party reports can be noisy, and the reporter may have incentives to choose who to include in this list. This survey was meant to use a more reliable method, even if more costly, both for accuracy and to understand whether estimates would be similar to those obtained using third-party reports. 

Therefore, we first had to establish a spatial boundary for the data collection, and ask all households within those boundaries which water point they used. One option would be to select a radius around water points with DSW and ILC and survey the households within this radius. However, we had little data available to inform the choice of such a radius, and the implementation of this sampling strategy in the field would be challenging. Instead, we decided to use villages as the sampling unit because we expect them to have more explicit and well-known boundaries that were relatively organically formed around a contiguous area of easy access for those within it. 

We designed the sample to be representative of areas where DSW had been active since before 2021 (called the "Footprint" sample group from now on), of areas where DSW activities started in 2021 or later (the "Expansion" sample group), and, in Malawi, of areas served by ILC (the "ILC" sample group). To this end, we aimed to sample 30 Footprint villages, 30 villages Expansion, and 40 villages served by ILC (called the ILC sample group from now on).\footnote{If a village was served by ILC, it was included in the ILC sample group, regardless of whether it was also a DSW Footprint or Expansion village.} 

Sampling in ILC areas had to take into account the fact that multiple villages may be part of the same pipeline, unlike villages in the DSW sample groups, which were treated as independent units. In an ILC setup, the water is pumped from a borehole, stored in one or multiple tanks with an ILC device by the borehole, and then distributed to water collection points, which may be spread across multiple villages, through pipes. This means that chlorine availability is not independently distributed across villages served by the same ILC device. Evidence Action's Adoption Monitoring estimates the number of people using all of the water collection points in a cluster, that is, all of those connected to the same water point with an ILC device. To approximate this method, when a sampled village was part of an ILC cluster, we considered the entire cluster to be sampled. For each sampled cluster, up to five villages were included in our sample. If a cluster covered more than five villages, the village where the ILC device was located was always included, and four other villages in the cluster were randomly sampled. As a result, our original sample included a total of 41 villages split into 31 clusters. 

Large ILC clusters are overrepresented in our sample. In Malawi, 95\% of the ILC clusters include up to 5 villages. The 13 large clusters out of the 285 existing ones include up to 73 villages each. This means that 244 out of 401 villages served by ILC are part of large clusters. Since we sampled at the village level, not the cluster level, villages in large clusters are overrepresented. However, we have found that these villages are not different from villages that are not part of clusters or those that are part of small clusters with regard to the data available. Therefore, in the analysis, we have treated villages in small and large clusters the same way as we treated villages that are not part of any clusters.

No statistically significant differences are found in the number of DSW water points between sampled and non-sampled villages or visited and non-visited villages, supporting the representativeness of the study sample\textcolor{red}{(TABLE X)}.

\subsection{Data collection instruments and protocols}\label{sec:design-instruments}

The data collection included five activities, listed below in the same order as they took place in each village. The fieldwork was led by IPA, with DIL staff being present for piloting in Uganda and during the first few weeks of data collection in Malawi. DIL also conducted real-time data quality checks.

\subsubsection{Village mapping}

Upon arrival at a village, field officers asked the village chairperson to appoint a knowledgeable person to guide them around the village. During this guided walk, they mapped the village boundaries and the water points in the village.\footnote{GPS coordinates were collected during this exercise, in an attempt to obtain a clear map of the village boundaries. However, this data turned out not to be useful, given that teams were mostly walking through roads, with guides pointing to the boundaries rather than walking around them, since they were often hard to reach.}

\subsubsection{Water point census}

During the guided walk, field officers recorded the GPS coordinates of all water points identified.\footnote{It two separate water points were within 20 meters of one another, they were considered the same water point.} If a water point was used by more than one compound to collect drinking water, additional data was collected, including the type of water source, if it was functional, and whether it had a DSW dispenser or ILC. 

Note that the inclusion criterion here is not exactly the same that Evidence Action uses to determine whether a water point is eligible to receive an intervention, which relies on \textcolor{red}{a water points being used by at least ten \textit{households}}. This could led to the exclusion of some Evidence Action water points from the water point census. To minimize this issue, a map with the location of all water points served DSW or ILC was provided to the field teams. 

A water point was classified as having a DSW dispenser if at least one of the three dispenser components was present during the visit: the casing, the PVC pole, and the chlorine tank. If a water point had a DSW dispenser, we collected data on dispenser functionality and dosing. If a water point with a DSW dispenser was functional, and the dispenser was functional and filled, field officers filled a jerrycan with water, turned the valve once, and waited for 30 minutes before testing the water for chlorine residual again. They also measured the amount of chlorine dispensed.\footnote{Depending on the reagent availability at the time, field officers also tested a water sample for chlorine residual before adding chlorine to it, to better understand the sources of noise and potential false positive in chlorine measurements.}

Water points with ILC, on the other hand, can be one of two types:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Taps from which the end user collects water, referred to as a \textit{water point connected to ILC} or \textit{ILC water collection point} from now on.
    \item Water points that feed the tank to which the ILC device is connected and from where water is distributed to the taps, referred to as \textit{water points with an ILC device} or \textit{ILC water point} from now on.
\end{itemize}
If multiple water collection points are connected to the same water point with an ILC device, the set of all the water points connected to each other through a pipe and sharing an ILC device is called a \textit{cluster}.

ILC devices were not always immediately visible or accessible, and field teams often relied on their guide to determine whether an ILC was present in a water point. The tanks where ILC devices are installed are typically elevated and sometimes covered, meaning the ILC device may not be visible from the ground. For safety reasons, field officers were told not to climb up to the tanks. 

A similar challenge arises with water collection points connected to ILC: it is not possible to observe if a tap is connected to a water point with ILC. Therefore, the field team had to rely on a knowledgeable local source to determine which water collection points were connected or not. This person was usually the village chairperson or a guide appointed by the chairperson to take the team to the water points in the village. At the water points, teams often talked to the ILC operators as well. Whether or not a tap is connected to ILC is the most noisy water point-level treatment variable in our data.

If a water point with an ILC device was functional and field officers could reach the ILC device without climbing the tank, they conducted a spotcheck to see if the ILC device was functional and filled with tablets. We expected the chlorine residual levels to be similar across water points supplied by the same tank. Therefore, if an ILC water point was connected to more than one functional water collection point in the village, we only tested water sample from two taps: the one that was the closest to the ILC device and the one that was the farthest, meaning we should have at least two water points tested per cluster per village. 

Teams were asked to take pictures of the water points, the dispensers and the ILC devices. A water collection point's connection to the ILC device cannot be directly observed, field teams relied on local guides or ILC operators to determine whether a tap water served by ILC. 

During data quality checks, we cross-checked the location of the DSW/ILC water points against the Evidence Action database. When field reports of whether a water source was served by Evidence Action did not match the administrative data, we checked the pictures taken by field teams at the water source. In the case of ILC water collection points, field teams were asked to call their local guides or the surveyed promoters to confirm whether a water tap was connected to a tank with ILC. If a water point in the Evidence Action database was not mapped, but was inside the village boundaries or close to households mapped in the census, the field team was asked to visit that water point.

\subsubsection{Household census}

All households identified within the boundaries of sampled villages were invited to participate in the household census. Field teams were also instructed to include all the households located within 200 meters of the village boundaries in the census, since these households might also use water points located within the village boundaries. However, the implementation of such strategy depends on the field team’s estimation of this distance, which we expect to be noisy.

If a household could not be reached in the first visit, or an eligible respondent (a household member above 18 years of age who is knowledgeable about water, typically a woman) was not present, field officers made two more attempts, over two consecutive days, to survey the household. Households that could not be surveyed after these attempts, were not present in the village when the household census was happening, or declined to participate, are considered non-responses. 

During the census, field officers asked households what their primary source of drinking water was, and tried to match that source to the water points identified in the water point census. They also inquired about the number of water sources used, basic household demographics, and household composition. Finally, if a household's primary water source was not served by Evidence Action, they also asked about the household's water treatment practices. Households whose primary source of drinking water was served by Evidence Action were not asked about this to avoid priming.

Field officers used water source names and type, as well as landmarks around the water point, to match the household’s report of primary source of drinking water to the water points identified in the census. They also indicated how confident they felt that the match was correct. If the household was using a private water point, rainwater, or a water point outside of the village boundaries, it would likely not be matched. 

During data quality checks, first IPA and the DIL compared the names of unmatched water points so the primary source of drinking water was defined for as many households as possible. If the household reported using a communal water point inside the village, but that water point wasn’t mapped, field teams were asked to map that water point after the census was concluded to determine whether a dispenser or ILC device was present, or if the water point was connected to an ILC device.

Our main estimates of the number of people served by Evidence Action are based on data from this survey.

\subsubsection{Household survey (census sample)}\label{design:hh}

At each sampled village, we randomly sampled 20 households among those matched to a water point served by Evidence Action to complete an additional survey. This more detailed household survey focused mainly on water treatment practices and included testing a sample of drinking water for chlorine residual.\footnote{The survey also included a module on knowledge about water treatment and perception of ILC or DSW. However, a coding issue introduced after the pilot disabled this module, very few observations were collected, preventing this analysis from being completed.}

The main objective of this survey was to estimate household-level chlorination rates. Each household was asked for a cup of drinking water stored at the household. Field officers tested the water samples for both TCR and FCR, and asked households whether they had done anything to that water to make it safeer to drink.\footnote{At the start of data collection, households were surveyed even if they didn’t have any water available for testing. When we noticed that this happened more frequently than anticipated, we a new household to the sample whenever this was observed. Because the data collection started first in Uganda, the proportion of households with water available is smaller for that country.}

Each team of field officers included five people, and each one of them had a color wheel to conduct household-level water tests. Colorimeters were also available, but in a smaller number, since they are considerably more expensive. As a result, during each day of the household survey, the colorimeters rotated among team members, who, on the days when they had the two instruments, used both of them to test the same water sample. In Malawi, each team had two colorimeters. In Uganda, the second batch of colorimeters arrived in the country after teams had already left the capital. As a result, each team carried a single colorimeter to sampled villages.\footnote{In Malawi, a few enumerators initially misunderstood when to use the colorimeter or the color wheel, and did not use a color wheel when they had a colorimeter with them. As a result, some households have missing color wheel observations. We asked these enumerators to test one extra household per village with both the color wheel and the colorimeter to make up for the lost sample to be used in the comparison of instruments.}

Our main estimates of chlorine adoption rate among households served by Evidence Action are based on data from this survey. 

\subsubsection{Promoter survey}\label{sec:design-pm}

Promoters were identified through a list provided by Evidence Action (thereafter referred to as "the Evidence Action list") which included the names and contacts of main and assistant promoters in each of the sampled villages. Field officers reached out to the main promoter to schedule a visit, and to the assistant promoter if the main promoter was not available. In some cases, when both the main and the assistant promoters were not included in the Evidence Action list, were unknown in the village, or had moved out of the village, field officers inquired about the person responsible for the dispenser or the ILC operator, and surveyed the people they were able to identify through this method.

The promoter was only contacted by the IPA team after the previously listed activities were complete. This usually happened around the fourth day of activities in a village. However, by the time promoters were contacted, promoters were often already aware of the ongoing surveys. In fact, a few promoters introduced themselves to the field team during the water point census and asked to participate in the activities. In such cases, teams were instructed to thank the promoters for their availability and let them know that they would be contacted when needed.

The promoter survey included a series of questions about the promoter activities and, most importantly, asked for a list of the users of a water point.\footnote{Note that the promoter is unlikely to know whether a household uses more than one water point or which one is the primary source of drinking water, so this exercise is not expected to yield exactly the same list of users as the household census.} If a water point was not functional at the time of the survey, the promoters were not asked for a list of users. The names in this list were then matched to the names of households in the household census.This was a time-consuming process, and often times required several clarifications with the promoter about the use of first names, last names or common names, as well as of different members of a household. Information about the number of households living outside of the village boundaries was collected to help understand mismatches.

This survey is used to obtain an estimate of the number of people served by Evidence Action that is equivalent to Evidence Action's Adoption Monitoring estimates. One key difference between our protocol and that of Evidence Action is the treatment of water points whose promoter we could not reach. When they cannot reach either the promoter or assistant promoter, Evidence Action staff interview the most knowledgeable other stakeholder in the community. In our protocol, the water point would not be included in the promoter survey if neither the promoter nor the assistant promoter could be reached.

\subsubsection{Household survey (promoter sample)}\label{sec:design-mon}

In addition to the 20 households sampled from the household census to complete the more detailed household survey, we also randomly sampled four households from each of the lists of users obtained from the promoters to complete the same survey. In other words, the survey instrument is identical to the one described in \ref{design:hh}, including the testing of water samples for chlorine residual, but with the sample drawn from the promoter survey. This data is used to obtain an estimate of chlorine adoption rate among households served by Evidence Action that is equivalent to Evidence Action's regular monitoring estimates. 

\subsubsection{\textcolor{red}{Chlorine testing}}\label{sec:design-chlorine}

\textcolor{red}{The SurveyCTO forms enumerators used for chlorine testing included step-by-step instructions with pictures and required enumerators to click through each step individually. Throughout training and data collection, supervisors emphasized the importance of following the standard protocols exactly as written. Enumerators rinsed the vial and cap thrice with sample water by shaking vigorously and wiped the vial with a clean cloth. After filling the vial with sample water to a line on the vial and adding the reagent powder, they shook the vial for 20 seconds, waited for 30 seconds or 3 minutes (total and free chlorine tests, respectively), and took the measurement. Enumerators with colorimeters zeroed the device after cleaning the vial, while enumerators with color wheels were instructed to take the visual measurement against sunlight or the tablet flashlight for consistent results.}

\textcolor{red}{Several data checks were done by both the field and data teams while data collection proceeded. In the field, supervisors conducted spotchecks by following enumerators and recording if they followed all protocols during the interviews and chlorine measurements at households. Supervisors also took their own reading during the color wheel tests due to the measurement's subjective nature. During all testing, enumerators were required to take photos of the opened reagent packet and measurement device with the reading. Chlorine tests that had inconsistencies with free against total chlorine, color wheel against colorimeter, and chlorine presence measurements were automatically flagged during high-frequency checks; these submissions were individually addressed alongside a photo review.}

\textcolor{red}{The Hach colorimeters were designed for use in a controlled laboratory setting. Due to natural circumstances from use in the field, readings from the colorimeters were consistently less \textcolor{blue}{trustworthy} than those from color wheels. For example, we often saw measurements of free chlorine being higher than total chlorine with the colorimeter. Due to this, we opted to use just results from the color wheel tests in our analysis. Water samples that were tested with the colorimeter were almost always tested with the color wheel as well, so the sample of households and water points with chlorine readings is as originally intended.}
