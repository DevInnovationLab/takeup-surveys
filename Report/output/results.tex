\subsection{Functionality and dosing}

\begin{itemize}
            \item 9 villages, served by 19 different water collection points, had no functional ILC water collection points at the time of the visit. \textcolor{red}{These villages are included in the analysis};
            \item \textcolor{red}{6 villages were served by 4 different water point had water collection points fed by a water point where the ILC was not connected to the tank when the visit happened. Since the water points were functional, they were tested for chlorine residual, and these villages are included in our analysis.}
            \item In 1 village, the ILC device served private households in the police compound. Although the community at large does not use the water points with ILC, the field team was able to survey the households that do, and this village is included in our analysis.
            \item In 4 villages included in the analysis, the field team was able to conduct the chlorine residual testing, but access to ILC was more restricted than expected. In 2 of them, because fewer water points were found than included in the administrative data, and in the other two 2, because some of the water points were private.
            \item \textcolor{red}{According to the reports of the village guides, five water points with ILC devices and 26 water collection points were not used by more than one compound.}
