\item[1] All TCR readings were taken with a color wheel.
\item[2] At each water point with a filled dispenser, water was collected using a 20 liter jerrycan, dilute chlorine solution from the dispenser was added to the water, and the chlorine residual was measured using a color wheel 30 minutes after the water water treated.
