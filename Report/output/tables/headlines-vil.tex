\begin{tablenotes}
\item[1] Confidence intervals are calculated based on standard errors clustered at the village level.
\item[2] The number of people using water points with DSW or ILC in a village is defined as the sum of all people living in households that use water points with DSW or ILC as their primary source of drinking water. During the first two weeks of data collection, data on the number of people living in a household was not collected due to a survey coding error. This affects eight villages in Uganda. For households in these villages, we impute the number of household members as the average across all households using water points with DSW in the same country and sample group (Expansion or Footprint).
\item[3] The data used for columns (1), (2), and (4) includes all households using a water point with DSW or ILC within the boundaries of sampled villages, except for households using water points with ILC in DSW villages.
