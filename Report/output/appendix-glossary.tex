\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{DSW water point:}
A water point is classified as having DSW in the WP census if at least one of the following elements is present: the concrete slab, the PVC pole, or the tank. If IPA data did not match EA data, the research team reviewed photos to determine whether one of these elements was present.

\item \textbf{Water point with ILC device/ILC water point:}\
A water point is classified as a water point with ILC device if an ILC device is present in the tank at that location. If IPA recorded a WP as having a device while EA did not, photos were reviewed to verify the presence of the device.
If EA recorded a WP as having a device while IPA did not, enumerator comments were checked to determine whether the device had been present but later removed.
If no comments indicated removal and the photos were inconclusive (e.g., due to the photo angle or the tank’s height), the water point was classified as a water point with ILC device.

\item \textbf{Water point connected to ILC/ILC water collection point:}
If IPA and EA data did not match, IPA was asked to confirm with the promoter whether the water point was connected to an ILC.

\item \textbf{Water point connected to ILC/ILC water collection point:}
The set of all the water collection points connected to each other through a pipe and sharing
an ILC device, plus the water point where the ILC device is installed. If the ILC water point and an ILC water collection point are located within 20 meters of one another, that water point is included in our data as a single observation, and marked as both an ILC water point and an ILC water collection point.

\item \textbf{Census Sample:} Households sampled into the Household Survey from those whose self-reported primary source of drinking water according to the Household Census was matched to a water point with DSW/ILC listed in the Water Point Census.

\item \textbf{Promoter sample:} Households sampled into the Household Survey from those included in the list of users of water points with DSW/ILC provided by the promoter.

\item \textbf{Functional water source:}
A water source is classified as functional if water was available on the day of the water point census.

\item \textbf{Functional DSW:} A dispenser is considered functional if the valve turns and chlorine is dispensed. In most cases where the DSW was not functional, a chlorine test was not conducted at the source.
\item \textbf{Functional ILC:} An ILC water device is considered functional if on the the day of the water point census, it is working, with water running through it.
