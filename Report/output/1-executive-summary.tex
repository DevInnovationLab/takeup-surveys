\section*{Executive summary}

\subsection*{Study objectives}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The primary objective of this study is to estimate the reach and take up of Evidence Action’s Dispensers for Safe Water (DSW) program in Uganda and Malawi as well Evidence Action’s In-Line Chlorination (ILC) program in Malawi.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We use the \textbf{total number of people living in households using water points in DSW/ILC as their primary source of drinking water} as the indicator for program reach.
        \item We use \textbf{Free Chlorine Residual (FCR) and Total Chlorine Residual (TCR) detection rates} in water samples collected at these households as the indicator for take-up of water treatment with chlorine.
    \end{itemize}
    \item The secondary objectives are to shed light on
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Whether the ILC devices and DSW dispensers are refilled properly to dose the recommended amount of chlorine.
        \item Whether Evidence Action's current monitoring protocols and the protocols designed by this study result in comparable measures of program access and adoption.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Reach and adoption estimates}

\subsubsection*{Uganda}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Based on data from 60 villages, we approximate that \textbf{3.9 million (95\% CI = 2.9 - 4.8 million)} people in Uganda use water points with dispensers as their primary source of drinking water.
    \item Based on the TCR tests performed with a color wheel in randomly sampled households that self-reported using water points with DSW, we estimate that \textbf{30.4\% (95\% CI = 24.8 - 36.1)} of reached households adopt chlorine as a water treatment method.
    \item At the time of the surveys, chlorine was \textcolor{blue}{available} at \textbf{64\%} of all the water points with DSW: 95\% of the 185 water points with DSW were functional, 70\% of dispensers in functional water points were functional and filled with chlorine, and FCR above 0.2 mg/L was detected in 96\% of the water samples treated with chlorine from filled and functional dispensers.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Malawi}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Our results are based on a sample of 99 hundred villages, 56 served by DSW and 43 served by ILC (24 of which are also served by DSW).
    \item We estimate that a total of \textbf{2 million (95\% CI = 1.3 - 2.7 million)} people are reached by DSW, with an adoption rate of \textbf{26.4\% (95\% CI = 21 - 31.9)}
    \item We estimate ILC to reach \textbf{75 thousand people (95\% CI = 49 - 102 thousand)} people, and TCR was detected in \textbf{30.7\% (CI 95\% = 24.8 - 36.1)} of the water samples tested from reached households.
    \item FCR above 0.2 mg/L was detected in\textbf{ 54\%} of the water points with DSW: 97.5\% of the 202 water points with DSW were functional, 58\% of the dispensers were functional and filled, and 96\% of the water samples treated at the water points were they were located had FCR detected.
    \textcolor{blue}{\item We observe 31 ILC clusters in our data. Out of these, 90\% had an ILC device installed, 89\% of which where functional. Around 85\% of the ILC water collection points were functional at the time of the survey. TCR was detected in water samples from 82\% of the water collection points closest to the ILC device, and FCR from 64\%. Among the other water collection points tested, only 26.5\% had FCR concentrations above 0.2 mg/L.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Comparison to Evidence Action's monitoring methods}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{blue}{how our methods are difference from EA's}
    \item In Uganda, following methods similar to Evidence Action's, we estimate that 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A total of \textbf{4 million \textcolor{red}{CI}} people are using water points with DSW in Uganda. Although this number is larger than our main estimate by \textcolor{red}{half a million people}, the difference between the two results is not statistically significant and can largely be explained by differences in protocols.

    \end{itemize}
    \item In Malawi, we find that 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 3 million people are using these water points (one million more than our main estimate). Although we are unable to test for this, we believe that this is because...
