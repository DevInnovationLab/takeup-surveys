\section{Final remarks}

This study aimed to estimate the take-up of Evidence Action’s Dispensers for Safe Water (DSW) and In-line Chlorination (ILC) programs. Using village-level censuses, household surveys, and water point inspections, we estimate that approximately 3.8 million people in Uganda and 2.2 million people in Malawi rely on water points with DSW/ILC as their primary source of drinking water.

Adoption rates, as measured by the presence of Total Chlorine Residual (TCR) in household water samples, range between 27\% and 33\% across village groups in both countries. While this represents a meaningful level of protection, it also underscores the challenge of ensuring consistent take-up and sustained use of chlorinated water at the household level. When DSW dispensers are functional and filled, they are generally dosing at the recommended levels, suggesting that gaps in adoption are related to the reliability of refilling among promoters and to household preferences and behaviors. 

\textcolor{red}{say something about ILC here}

Following Evidence Action’s Adoption Monitoring methods yielded higher estimates of the number of people using water points with DSW and ILC in Malawi than our preferred method, and higher chlorine detection rates in Uganda. Chlorine detection rates from Evidence Action's DSW Q3 Adoption Monitoring are also higher than those calculated from our survey. 

\textcolor{red}{summarise why we think this is}

Since using water points as a unit of reference yields similar results to village-level estimates, it may be preferable to the latter if it is less costly. The challenge remains, however, of also identifying the households using the water sources with DSW or ILC with a less resource-consuming process than a census. 

\textcolor{red}{say something about colorimeter vs color wheel here}

With regard to the other question raised in this study’s concept note, regarding factors that influence the choice of water source and the decision to treat the drinking water with chlorine, although it is beyond the scope of this report, the data collected allows for ample opportunity for further research. \textcolor{red}{Future exploration of this data could help define a threshold for radius around a water point for future adoption monitoring.}
