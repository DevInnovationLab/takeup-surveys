             \item[1] There are three separate tanks by this water point, and only one seems to have an ILC device. Chlorine was detected in all water collection points connected to this water point, except for one. The water collection point where chlorine was not detected was likely connected to one of the tanks without an ILC device.
            \item[2] There are two tanks by this water point.
            \item[3] There are two tanks by this water point. One of them is broken and the other is functional with a functional device. 
            \item[4] There are two tanks by this water point, but only one has an ILC device, and it is leaking.
            \item[5] The water point with the tank is located very far from the sampled village and was not visited. 
            \item[6] The test that detected chlorine could not be verified by the picture and the colorimeter result does not confirm the detection.
            \item[7] The village where the water point with the tank is located is not in the sample, and that water point was not visited.
            \item[8] The water point with the tank is located far away from all of the villages that it serves.
            \item[9]The village in the data is not the same as where the water collection points are located. Still, the water point itself was mapped.
            \item[10] No data is available on the presence on tablets in the ILC device.
            \item[11] Water pressure was low when the water point was visited (likely because there was no sunlight). The ILC device contained one tablet.
            \item[12] According to the operator, there were two tablets int he ILC device.
            \item[13] The ILC has not been functional for years: it is too small for the system and the operator bypassed it. 
            \item[14] All color wheel tests returned a reading of 0 mg/L, with the exception of the TCR test for the closest WCP, which read 0.2 mg/L according to the field team. This reading could not be verified in the picture because the enumerator's hand prevent light from passing through the sample. The colorimeter reading for the same WCP is of 0.07 mg/L.
            \item[15] The ILC device was removed three months before the census took place.
