82042386 & 1 & 1 & 1 & The field team could not identify the issue with the water. point, but reported that it had been dry for about a week by the time the survey took place. \\
83050457 & 2 & 2 & 2 & The water point had been out of order for the five months the preceded the survey. \\
84032512 & 34 & 8 & 8 & Water point is located very far from the visited village and was not included in the census. Either the coordinate is incorrect in the Evidence Action data, or there was a mistake in the village assignment. It's not clear what is not working: the pump or all taps. \\
85025752 & 5 & 5 & 4 & The water point is not working, likely because of lack of power. There were no tablets in the ILC device. \\
84032513 & 125 & 13 & 1 & Only one village in this cluster is in our sample. Single water collection point in the sample is not functional. It is likely that there was an error in the assignment of the village code.\\
